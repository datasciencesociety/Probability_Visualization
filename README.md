# Interactive Probability Visualization
There is short description of each of the probability distributions Thiss includes both discrete and continuous probability distributions. Some of the feature are. Holoviews is used to make the visualizations. The visualizations are plots of histograms, pdf (probability density function) or pmf (probability mass function) for the discrete and cdf (cumulative density functions). Sliders are added as widgets to change the parameters.
